# Report-Electoral-System
This is a joint project created by the team of 1st Semester Undergrad students at GIKI. The team members' name and their respective Reg Numbers are as follow: Naik Alam - 2024515 , Abdullah Khan - 2024040 , Shahan Ali - 2024572 , Syed Moin Ud din Shah - 2024612.
Our aim was to create a digital platform that simplifies the voting process by allowing election commissions to manage candidates and voters to cast their votes securely. The system features password-protected menus, candidate registration, and real-time vote tallying. Additionally, we applied file handling techniques to enhance data storage and retrieval, ensuring the system is both functional and scalable. Through this project, we honed our problem-solving and teamwork skills, exploring practical applications of C++ in real-world scenarios.
